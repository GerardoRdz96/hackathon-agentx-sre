# Incidex — AI-Powered SRE Agent

**A 5-agent AI pipeline that triages e-commerce incidents in seconds instead of 47 minutes. A [Penguin Alley](https://penguinalley.com) product.**

Built for the [AgentX Hackathon 2026](https://www.softserveinc.com/) by SoftServe.

**Team:** [Penguin Alley](https://penguinalley.com) (Solo — Luis Gerardo Rodríguez García, Monterrey, MX)
**Architecture inspired by:** [PA·co](https://github.com/PenguinAlleyApps/paco-framework) — a production multi-agent operating system with 12 agents across 5 departments, built on Anthropic Claude. The agent pipeline pattern, model tiering strategy, and observability architecture in this project are battle-tested patterns from PA·co's 100+ autonomous build sessions.

## The Problem

Site Reliability Engineering teams at e-commerce companies face a critical bottleneck: **incident triage is manual, slow, and inconsistent**. When a payment gateway fails at 2 AM, the on-call engineer must read logs, scan code, form hypotheses, assign severity, and route to the right team — all while the site bleeds revenue. Industry average MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution) starts at **47 minutes** just for triage and routing.

## The Solution

A **5-agent Claude pipeline** that ingests an incident report (text + optional screenshot), analyzes logs and source code, generates ranked hypotheses, and routes a ticket to the correct team — all in **~20-28 seconds**. Each agent is purpose-built with the right model for its task.

## Architecture

```
INCIDENT IN (text + screenshot)
        |
  [Agent 1: TRIAGE]            Haiku   ~1s   Classify severity, component, type
        |
  [Agent 2: LOG ANALYST]  ──┐  Sonnet  ~9s   Pattern-match across 200+ log entries
  [Agent 3: CODE ANALYST]  ──┘  Sonnet  ~7s   Scan 9 source files for root cause
        |                  PARALLEL (Promise.allSettled)
  [Agent 4: HYPOTHESIS]         Sonnet  ~9s   Synthesize findings into ranked hypotheses
        |
  [Agent 5: ROUTER]             Deterministic  ~2ms   Assign team, create ticket, notify
        |
  TICKET + NOTIFICATIONS + FULL TRACE TIMELINE
```

**Total pipeline: ~20-28 seconds** — a 99% reduction from the 47-minute industry average for manual triage.
**Cost per incident: ~$0.01-0.02** (Haiku triage + Haiku routing ≈ 500 tokens, Sonnet analysis ≈ 2000 tokens). At 1,000 incidents/day: ~$15-20/day.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Framework** | Next.js 15 (App Router, Turbopack) | Server actions, API routes, and React Server Components in one codebase |
| **Language** | TypeScript | Type safety across the agent pipeline — every agent has typed inputs/outputs |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS 4 | Utility-first, fast iteration on the mission control dashboard |
| **AI SDK** | `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (v0.82) | Direct Claude API access — no abstraction layers between us and the models |
| **Database** | SQLite + Drizzle ORM | Zero-config persistence for incidents, traces, and agent results |
| **Container** | Docker + Docker Compose | One command to run. Volumes for SQLite data and uploaded screenshots |

### Model Selection Rationale

We use **two Claude models** selected for the right tradeoff between speed, cost, and reasoning depth at each pipeline stage:

| Model | Used By | Latency | Cost (Input) | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Haiku** | Triage Agent | ~1s | $0.25/MTok | Classification is a **structured, low-ambiguity task**. Haiku delivers sub-second responses with high accuracy for severity/component classification. Cost-efficient for high-volume triage. |
| **Deterministic** | Router Agent | ~2ms | $0 | Routing is rule-based (component → team mapping). No LLM needed — faster and cheaper than any model call. |
| **Claude Sonnet** | Log Analyst, Code Analyst, Hypothesis Engine | ~2-3s | $3/MTok | Log pattern matching across 200+ entries, source code analysis across 9 files, and multi-step hypothesis generation all require **deeper reasoning and longer context windows**. Sonnet's stronger code understanding produces higher-quality root cause analysis. |
| **Claude Sonnet (Vision)** | Triage Agent (when screenshot attached) | ~2s | $3/MTok | Screenshots of Grafana dashboards or error pages are sent as base64 images. Vision extracts error patterns, status codes, and anomalies that text descriptions miss. |

**Why not Opus?** Opus would improve hypothesis quality marginally but at 5x the cost and 3x the latency. For an SRE pipeline where **speed is the metric**, Sonnet hits the sweet spot.

## How It Works (End-to-End Flow)

### 1. Incident Intake

A user submits an incident through the dashboard form: a title, description, optional reporter email, and optional screenshot (e.g., a Grafana panel showing a spike in 500 errors). Input passes through **guardrails** before reaching any agent:

- Canary string detection (10 known prompt injection phrases)
- Regex-based prompt injection pattern filtering (template injections, instruction tags)
- HTML/script tag stripping
- Null byte removal
- Input length validation (10,000 character max)

### 2. Triage Agent (Haiku, ~1s)

Classifies the incident into **severity** (critical/high/medium/low), **component** (payment, checkout, inventory, auth, etc.), and **type** (performance, error, security, data). If a screenshot is attached, Claude Vision analyzes it alongside the text description.

### 3. Log Analyst + Code Analyst (Sonnet, parallel, ~2-3s)

Running concurrently via `Promise.allSettled()`:

- **Log Analyst** searches 200+ simulated log entries filtered by the triaged component, identifies error patterns, timestamps, and anomalies
- **Code Analyst** scans 9 Medusa.js source files for bugs matching the incident pattern — race conditions, missing null checks, incorrect error handling

### 4. Hypothesis Engine (Sonnet, ~9s)

Synthesizes triage classification, log findings, and code findings into **ranked hypotheses** with confidence scores, affected files, and suggested fixes. Each hypothesis is actionable — not just "something is wrong" but "the payment webhook handler at line 42 has a race condition causing double charges."

### 5. Router & Notifier (Haiku, ~1s)

Based on severity and component, assigns the incident to the correct team (e.g., `payments-backend`, `platform-infra`), creates a Linear-style ticket, and triggers mock Slack/email notifications. Critical incidents get escalation paths.

### 6. Resolution

Engineers mark incidents resolved from the dashboard. The reporter receives a notification. Full trace history is preserved for post-mortems.

## Responsible AI

This system is designed with responsible AI principles embedded at every layer:

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Fairness** | Severity classification is based on technical signals (error rates, component impact), not on who reported it. Every incident follows the same 5-agent pipeline regardless of source. |
| **Transparency** | The trace timeline shows exactly what each agent received, processed, and concluded — with timestamps and token counts. No black-box decisions. |
| **Accountability** | Every agent decision is logged in SQLite with the model used, latency, and full output. Traces are immutable once written. |
| **Privacy** | Input sanitization strips potential PII before it reaches the LLM. No user data is stored beyond what is needed for incident resolution. Output truncation prevents data leakage in responses. |
| **Security** | Multi-layer prompt injection protection: canary string detection, regex pattern filtering, HTML stripping, length validation, and output truncation at 5,000 characters. |
| **Human Oversight** | The system triages and recommends — it does not auto-remediate. Engineers review hypotheses and decide on fixes. Resolution requires explicit human action. |
